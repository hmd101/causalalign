1,"In the following, you will be presented with causal inference tasks based on a causal mechanism consisting of 3 variables that works like this:high A causes long C. Also, small B causes long C. Now suppose you observe the following:  long C, small B. Given the observations and the causal mechanism, how likely on a scale from 0 to 100 is high A? 0 means definitely not likely and 100 means definitely likely.

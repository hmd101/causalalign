1,"Economists seek to describe and predict the regular patterns of economic fluctuation. To do this, they study some important variables or attributes of economies. They also study how these attributes are responsible for producing or causing one another. Here are some variables: Interest rates are the rates banks charge to loan money. Some economies have low interest rates. Others have normal interest rates. A country's trade deficit is the difference between the value of the goods that a country imports and the value of the goods that a country exports. Some economies have small trade deficits. Others have normal trade deficits. Retirement savings is the money people save for their retirement. Some economies have high retirement savings. Others have normal retirement savings. Here are the causal relationships:  low interest rates cause high retirement savings.  small trade deficits cause high retirement savings. Suppose that the economy is currently known to have high retirement savings and small trade deficits. Your task is to estimate how likely it is that low interest rates are present on a scale from 0 to 100, given the observations and causal relationships described. 0 means completely unlikely and 100 means completely certain.

182;"Meteorologists seek to describe and predict the regular patterns that govern weather systems. To do this, they study some important variables or attributes of weather systems. They also study how these attributes are responsible for producing or causing one another. Assume you live in a world that works like this:  low ozone levels cause low humidity. The low amount of ozone allows a large number of ultra-violet (UV) rays to enter the atmosphere, and the UV rays break up water molecules, resulting in low humidity. Also, low air pressure cause low humidity. Low air pressure poorly facilitates condensation; as a result, there are less water molecules in the air. Now suppose you observe the following: low humidity and high ozone levels. Given the observations and the causal mechanism, how likely on a scale from 0 to 100 is low air pressure? Please provide a number between 0 and 100 that indicates how likely the question is given the observations and causal mechanism, where 0 means highly unlikely and 100 is very likely.

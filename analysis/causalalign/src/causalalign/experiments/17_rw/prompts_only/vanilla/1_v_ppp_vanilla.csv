98;Sociologists seek to describe and predict the regular patterns of societal interactions. To do this, they study some important variables or attributes of societies. They also study how these attributes are responsible for producing or causing one another. Assume you live in a world that works like this:  high urbanization cause high socio-economic mobility. Big cities provide many opportunities for financial and social improvement. Also, low interest in religion cause high socio-economic mobility. Without the restraint of religion-based morality, the impulse toward greed dominates and people tend to accumulate material wealth. Now suppose you observe the following: low urbanization. Given the observations and the causal mechanism, how likely on a scale from 0 to 100 is low interest in religion? Please provide a number between 0 and 100 that indicates how likely the question is given the observations and causal mechanism, where 0 means highly unlikely and 100 is very likely.

76;Meteorologists seek to describe and predict the regular patterns that govern weather systems. To do this, they study some important variables or attributes of weather systems. They also study how these attributes are responsible for producing or causing one another. Assume you live in a world that works like this:  high ozone levels cause high humidity. Ozone attracts extra oxygen atoms from water molecules, creating a concentration of water vapor in that region. Also, low air pressure cause high humidity. When pressure does not force water vapor to break into oxygen and hydrogen atoms, water vapor remains in abundance. Now suppose you observe the following: low ozone levels.

They also study how these attributes are responsible for producing or causing one another. Assume you live in a world that works like this:  high ozone levels cause high humidity. Ozone attracts extra oxygen atoms from water molecules, creating a concentration of water vapor in that region. Also, low air pressure cause high humidity. When pressure does not force water vapor to break into oxygen and hydrogen atoms, water vapor remains in abundance. Now suppose you observe the following: high ozone levels. Given the observations and the causal mechanism, how likely on a scale from 0 to 100 is low air pressure? Please provide a number between 0 and 100 that indicates how likely the question is given the observations and causal mechanism, where 0 means highly unlikely and 100 is very likely.

Low interest rates stimulate economic growth, leading to greater prosperity overall, and allowing more money to be saved for retirement in particular. Also, small trade deficits cause high retirement savings. When the economy is good, people can cover their basic expenses and so have enough money left over to contribute to their retirement accounts.

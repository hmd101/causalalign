35;Sociologists seek to describe and predict the regular patterns of societal interactions. To do this, they study some important variables or attributes of societies. They also study how these attributes are responsible for producing or causing one another. Assume you live in a world that works like this:  high urbanization cause low socio-economic mobility. In big cities many people are competing for the same high-status jobs and occupations. Also, high interest in religion cause low socio-economic mobility. The spiritualism induced by religion works to reduce the desire for material wealth. Now suppose you observe the following: high socio-economic mobility. Given the observations and the causal mechanism, how likely on a scale from 0 to 100 is high urbanization? Please provide a number between 0 and 100 that indicates how likely the question is given the observations and causal mechanism, where 0 means highly unlikely and 100 is very likely.

210;Meteorologists seek to describe and predict the regular patterns that govern weather systems. To do this, they study some important variables or attributes of weather systems. They also study how these attributes are responsible for producing or causing one another. Assume you live in a world that works like this:  high ozone levels cause low humidity. Ozone accepts extra oxygen atoms, decreasing the amount of oxygen available to form water molecules. With fewer water molecules, there is lower humidity. Also, high air pressure cause low humidity. When air pressure is high, water vapor condenses into liquid water (rain), and the atmosphere is left with little moisture. Now suppose you observe the following: high humidity and high ozone levels.

The good economic times produced by the low interest rates leads to greater confidence and less worry about the future, so people are less concerned about retirement. Also, large trade deficits cause low retirement savings. The loss of local manufacturing jobs means that there are people out of work, and contributions to retirement accounts decreases.

The good economic times produced by the low interest rates leads to greater confidence and less worry about the future, so people are less concerned about retirement. Also, large trade deficits cause low retirement savings. The loss of local manufacturing jobs means that there are people out of work, and contributions to retirement accounts decreases.

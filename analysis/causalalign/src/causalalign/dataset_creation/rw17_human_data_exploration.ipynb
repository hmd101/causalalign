The following notebook explains how to algoritmically re-create the the textual form used by RW17 and also, how to easily create new prompts.\n",

    "- ** Counterbalance-dependent Sense Assignments (`p/m`)**: How we represent conditions in counterbalanced ways (optional, but used in RW17). Essentially, this flips the senses of what it means for the variable to be on (1) or off (0).\n",

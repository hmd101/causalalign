The following notebook explains how to algoritmically re-create the the textual form used by RW17 and also, how to easily create new prompts.\n",

    "- ** Counterbalance-dependent Sense Assignments (`p/m`)**: How we represent conditions in counterbalanced ways (optional, but used in RW17). Essentially, this flips the senses of what it means for the variable to be on (1) or off (0).\n",

    "Note that the function `expand_df_by_task_queries()` hands us back the necessary building blocks for verbalizing the entire prompt for every single of the 8 possible counterbalance conditions and every one of the 20 inference tasks. (Hence, the function `expand_df_by_task_queries()` will return a  dataframe with num_cntbl_conds * num_tasks, i.e. here: $8\\cdot 20 = 160$ rows. Importanlty, the values for each variable node C1, C2, and E are only *1*, the variable-senses (high, low, small, etc.) for *0* are *not* contained in the dataframe. We have to look up the off-values (0) in the nested dictionary created by `create_domain_dict()`. The function `verbalize_inference_task()` does take care of this, when we want to verbalize an inference task that contains an off-value.\n",

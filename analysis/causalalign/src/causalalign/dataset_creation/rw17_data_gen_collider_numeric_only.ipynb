The following notebook explains how to algoritmically re-create the the textual form used by RW17 and also, how to easily create new prompts.\n",

    "- ** Counterbalance-dependent Sense Assignments (`p/m`)**: How we represent conditions in counterbalanced ways (optional, but used in RW17). Essentially, this flips the senses of what it means for the variable to be on (1) or off (0).\n",

Humidity is the degree to which the atmosphere contains water molecules. Some weather systems have high humidity. Others have normal humidity. Here are the causal relationships:  high ozone levels cause high humidity.  Ozone tends to rapidly break down into normal oxygen, leaving more oxygen available for the formation of water molecules (H2O). low air pressure cause high humidity. When pressure does not force water vapor to break into oxygen and hydrogen atoms, water vapor remains in abundance. Suppose that there is a weather system that is known to have normal ozone levels. Your task is to estimate how likely it is that low air pressure are present on a scale from 0 to 100, given the observations and causal relationships described. 0 means completely unlikely and 100 means completely certain.

      " 'Meteorologists seek to describe and predict the regular patterns that govern weather systems. To do this, they study some important variables or attributes of weather systems. They also study how these attributes are responsible for producing or causing one another. Here are some variables: Ozone is a gaseous allotrope of oxygen (O3) and is formed by exposure to UV radiation. Some weather systems have high ozone levels. Others have normal ozone levels. Air pressure is force exerted due to concentrations of air molecules. Some weather systems have high air pressure. Others have normal air pressure. Humidity is the degree to which the atmosphere contains water molecules. Some weather systems have low humidity. Others have normal humidity. Here are the causal relationships:  high ozone levels cause low humidity.  Ozone attracts extra oxygen atoms from water molecules, creating a concentration of water vapor in that region. high air pressure cause low humidity. When air pressure is high, water vapor condenses into liquid water (rain), and the atmosphere is left with little moisture. Suppose that there is a weather system that is known to have normal humidity and high air pressure. Your task is to estimate how likely it is that high ozone levels are present on a scale from 0 to 100, given the observations and causal relationships described. 0 means completely unlikely and 100 means completely certain.

      " 'Meteorologists seek to describe and predict the regular patterns that govern weather systems. To do this, they study some important variables or attributes of weather systems. They also study how these attributes are responsible for producing or causing one another. Here are some variables: Ozone is a gaseous allotrope of oxygen (O3) and is formed by exposure to UV radiation. Some weather systems have low ozone levels. Others have normal ozone levels. Air pressure is force exerted due to concentrations of air molecules. Some weather systems have low air pressure. Others have normal air pressure. Humidity is the degree to which the atmosphere contains water molecules. Some weather systems have low humidity. Others have normal humidity. Here are the causal relationships:  low ozone levels cause low humidity.  The low amount of ozone allows a large number of ultra-violet (UV) rays to enter the atmosphere, and the UV rays break up water molecules, resulting in low humidity. low air pressure cause low humidity. Low air pressure poorly facilitates condensation; as a result, there are less water molecules in the air. Suppose that there is a weather system that is known to have normal humidity and low air pressure. Your task is to estimate how likely it is that low ozone levels are present on a scale from 0 to 100, given the observations and causal relationships described. 0 means completely unlikely and 100 means completely certain.  Return your response as raw text in one single line using this exact XML format: <response><likelihood>YOUR_NUMERIC_RESPONSE_HERE</likelihood></response> Replace YOUR_NUMERIC_RESPONSE_HERE with your likelihood estimate between 0 (very unlikely) and 100 (very likely).

      " 'Meteorologists seek to describe and predict the regular patterns that govern weather systems. To do this, they study some important variables or attributes of weather systems. They also study how these attributes are responsible for producing or causing one another. Here are some variables: Ozone is a gaseous allotrope of oxygen (O3) and is formed by exposure to UV radiation. Some weather systems have low ozone levels. Others have normal ozone levels. Air pressure is force exerted due to concentrations of air molecules. Some weather systems have high air pressure. Others have normal air pressure. Humidity is the degree to which the atmosphere contains water molecules. Some weather systems have high humidity. Others have normal humidity. Here are the causal relationships:  low ozone levels cause high humidity.  The oxygen atoms that would normally be part of ozone molecules are free to combine with hydrogen atoms instead, creating water molecules. high air pressure cause high humidity. The higher pressure means that the components of water molecules (hydrogen and oxygen) tend to not dissocciate from one another. Because there are more water molecules, humidity is higher. Suppose that there is a weather system that is known to have normal humidity and high air pressure.

Socioeconomic mobility is the degree to which the members of a society are able to improve their social and economic status. Some societies have high socio-economic mobility. Others have normal socio-economic mobility. Here are the causal relationships:  low urbanization cause high socio-economic mobility.  People in rural areas are rarely career oriented, and so take time off from working and switch frequently between different \"temp\" jobs. high interest in religion cause high socio-economic mobility. Religion fosters communal care, and those of the same religion tend to support each other with jobs, financial favors, and so on. Suppose that the society you live in currently exhibits the following: high interest in religion. Your task is to estimate how likely it is that low urbanization are present on a scale from 0 to 100, given the observations and causal relationships described. 0 means completely unlikely and 100 means completely certain.

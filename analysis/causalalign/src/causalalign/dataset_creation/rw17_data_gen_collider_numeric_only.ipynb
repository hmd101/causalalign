The following notebook explains how to algoritmically re-create the the textual form used by RW17 and also, how to easily create new prompts.\n",

    "- ** Counterbalance-dependent Sense Assignments (`p/m`)**: How we represent conditions in counterbalanced ways (optional, but used in RW17). Essentially, this flips the senses of what it means for the variable to be on (1) or off (0).\n",

Importanlty, the values for each variable node C1, C2, and E are only *1*, the variable-senses (high, low, small, etc.) for *0* are *not* contained in the dataframe. We have to look up the off-values (0) in the nested dictionary created by `create_domain_dict()`.

1;<response><explanation>Low interest rates cause high retirement savings, but small trade deficits also cause high retirement savings. Since both conditions are present, it is highly likely that low interest rates are also present.</explanation><likelihood>90</likelihood><confidence>80</confidence></response>;numeric-confidence-CoT;collider;economy;a;ppp;gpt-3.5-turbo;0.0
2;<response><explanation>Low interest rates cause high retirement savings, but small trade deficits do not have a direct causal relationship with retirement savings. Therefore, the presence of small trade deficits is not directly related to the observed high retirement savings and low interest rates.</explanation><likelihood>20</likelihood><confidence>70</confidence></response>;numeric-confidence-CoT;collider;economy;a;ppp;gpt-3.5-turbo;0.0
3;<response><explanation>Both low interest rates and small trade deficits are linked to high retirement savings. Since we are observing high retirement savings, it is likely that low interest rates are present as well.</explanation><likelihood>80</likelihood><confidence>85</confidence></response>;numeric-confidence-CoT;collider;economy;b;ppp;gpt-3.5-turbo;0.0
4;<response><explanation>Low interest rates cause high retirement savings, not small trade deficits. Therefore, it is unlikely that small trade deficits are present.</explanation><likelihood>10</likelihood><confidence>80</confidence></response>;numeric-confidence-CoT;collider;economy;b;ppp;gpt-3.5-turbo;0.0
5;<response><explanation>High retirement savings are caused by low interest rates, but not by trade deficits. Since we observe high retirement savings and normal trade deficits, it is likely that low interest rates are present.</explanation><likelihood>80</likelihood><confidence>85</confidence></response>;numeric-confidence-CoT;collider;economy;c;ppp;gpt-3.5-turbo;0.0
6;<response><explanation>Low interest rates and small trade deficits both lead to high retirement savings. Since we observe high retirement savings and normal interest rates, it is likely that small trade deficits are present as well.</explanation><likelihood>80</likelihood><confidence>85</confidence></response>;numeric-confidence-CoT;collider;economy;c;ppp;gpt-3.5-turbo;0.0
7;<response><explanation>Small trade deficits cause high retirement savings, which in turn causes low interest rates.</explanation><likelihood>90</likelihood><confidence>80</confidence></response>;numeric-confidence-CoT;collider;economy;d;ppp;gpt-3.5-turbo;0.0
8;<response><explanation>Low interest rates are known to cause high retirement savings, but there is no direct causal relationship between low interest rates and small trade deficits. Therefore, the presence of low interest rates does not provide any information about the likelihood of small trade deficits.</explanation><likelihood>50</likelihood><confidence>70</confidence></response>;numeric-confidence-CoT;collider;economy;d;ppp;gpt-3.5-turbo;0.0
9;<response><explanation>Normal trade deficits are not directly related to interest rates or retirement savings, so the likelihood of low interest rates being present is uncertain.</explanation><likelihood>50</likelihood><confidence>70</confidence></response>;numeric-confidence-CoT;collider;economy;e;ppp;gpt-3.5-turbo;0.0
10;<response><explanation>Normal interest rates do not directly impact trade deficits or retirement savings. However, low interest rates are linked to high retirement savings, which in turn are linked to small trade deficits. Therefore, it is somewhat likely that small trade deficits are present.</explanation><likelihood>60</likelihood><confidence>70</confidence></response>;numeric-confidence-CoT;collider;economy;e;ppp;gpt-3.5-turbo;0.0

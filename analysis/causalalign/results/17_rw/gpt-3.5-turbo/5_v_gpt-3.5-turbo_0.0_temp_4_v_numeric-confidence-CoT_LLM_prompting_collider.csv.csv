Based on the causal relationships described, we know that low urbanization causes high socio-economic mobility, and high interest in religion also causes high socio-economic mobility. Since we are currently observing normal interest in religion and low urbanization, it is likely that high socio-economic mobility is present because one of the causal factors (interest in religion) is still present. Therefore, I estimate the likelihood of high socio-economic mobility to be relatively high.

Based on the causal relationships described, we know that high air pressure causes high humidity. Since we are currently observing high humidity and normal ozone levels, and we know that low ozone levels also cause high humidity, it is possible that high air pressure is present. Therefore, I estimate the likelihood of high air pressure being present to be high.

Based on the causal relationships described, low ozone levels are known to cause high humidity. However, the current observations show normal humidity and high air pressure, which is not consistent with the conditions that typically lead to low ozone levels.

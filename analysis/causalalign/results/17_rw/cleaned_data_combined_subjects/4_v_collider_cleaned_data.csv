Assuming, in the absence of further information, that the prior probabilities are equal (e.g., P(H_U)=0.5, P(L_IR)=0.5), that the causes are independent, and that each cause reliably produces the effect (P(H_SEM|H_U)≈1, P(H_SEM|L_IR)≈1, P(H_SEM|neither)≈0), then the probability of observing H_SEM is roughly P(H_U or L_IR) = P(H_U) + P(L_IR) - P(H_U)P(L_IR) = 0.5 + 0.5 - (0.5*0.5) = 0.75.

Without information on the base rates (prior probabilities) of low U and high R, or how likely each is to cause high M, we must make an assumption. A common approach under uncertainty is to assume the potential causes are equally likely a priori. Let P(low U) = P(high R) = 0.5. Assuming these are independent causes and sufficient to cause high M (i.e., P(high M | low U) = 1, P(high M | high R) = 1) and that there are no other causes (P(high M | high U, low R) = 0), we can use Bayes' theorem or logic.

The fact that Low M is observed provides less evidence for Low R than it would if Low U were not observed, because Low U already accounts for Low M. In the simplest case where Low U is sufficient to cause Low M, observing Low U completely explains Low M, and the observation of Low M provides no additional information about Low R. In this scenario, the likelihood of Low R would be its baseline or prior probability. Without knowing the baseline probability of Low R, a neutral estimate is 50 on a scale of 0 to 100. If the causal links are probabilistic, observing Low M would increase the likelihood of Low R above its baseline, but observing Low U would then decrease this likelihood (explaining away), moving it back towards the baseline. Depending on the specific probabilities, the final likelihood could be slightly above the baseline, but lacking this information, 50 remains the most neutral estimate reflecting that the observed effect is explained by an observed cause.",60.0

We are given two potential causes: C1 ('low urbanization') and C2 ('low interest in religion'). Both C1 and C2 are stated to cause E (C1 -> E, C2 -> E). Observing the effect E provides evidence for *both* potential causes. Therefore, the likelihood of C1 ('low urbanization') increases given the observation E. However, C1 is not the only explanation; C2 could also be the cause. The existence of this alternative explanation (C2) means we cannot be certain about C1. The observation E supports C1, making it more likely than its baseline probability, but the possibility that C2 caused E reduces the certainty about C1. Assuming C1 and C2 are independent and roughly comparable explanations (in terms of prior likelihood and causal strength), observing E makes it likely that at least one of C1 or C2 is present. The probability is distributed across possibilities involving C1, C2, or both. Therefore, the likelihood of C1 given E is increased but is significantly less than 100. A value moderately above 50 is reasonable, reflecting the support from the observation E, tempered by the alternative explanation C2. Estimating this without priors or causal strengths requires assumptions; a common result in such ""explaining away"" scenarios under simple assumptions (like equal priors and deterministic OR) is around 2/3, or ~67.

Therefore, the likelihood of C2 increases upon observing E. However, since C1 is an alternative explanation for E, we cannot be certain about C2. To estimate the likelihood numerically without prior probabilities or information about the relationship between C1 and C2, we make standard assumptions: C1 and C2 are independent, their prior probabilities are equal (P(C1)=P(C2)=0.5), and the causal links are strong (deterministic OR model: E occurs if C1 or C2 occurs). Under these assumptions, the prior probability of E is P(E) = P(C1 U C2) = P(C1) + P(C2) - P(C1)P(C2) = 0.5 + 0.5 - (0.5*0.5) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. The probability of C2 given E is P(C2|E) = P(E|C2)P(C2)/P(E). Since C2 causes E, P(E|C2)=1 in the deterministic model. Thus, P(C2|E) = 1 * P(C2) / P(E) = 0.5 / 0.75 = 2/3.

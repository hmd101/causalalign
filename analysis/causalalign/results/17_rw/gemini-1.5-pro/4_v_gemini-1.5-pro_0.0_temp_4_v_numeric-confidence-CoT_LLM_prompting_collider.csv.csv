Low interest in religion is known to cause high socio-economic mobility, so the observed low interest in religion can explain the observed high socio-economic mobility. High urbanization also causes high socio-economic mobility. Since we already have an explanation for the high socio-economic mobility (low interest in religion), the presence of high urbanization becomes less certain, but not impossible.  It's possible that both factors are contributing to the high socio-economic mobility, or that only low interest in religion is the primary cause.

We are observing normal socio-economic mobility.

Low interest in religion causes high socio-economic mobility. Since we observe normal socio-economic mobility, it is less likely that there is low interest in religion.

Since high socio-economic mobility is observed and one of its causes (high interest in religion) is also observed, it is less likely that the other cause (low urbanization) is also present. If low urbanization were also present, it would make the already observed high socio-economic mobility even more likely, which is not necessary to explain the observation. Therefore, the presence of high interest in religion makes the presence of low urbanization less likely, although not impossible.

High air pressure also causes high humidity, but normal air pressure is observed. This neither increases nor decreases the likelihood of high humidity. Therefore, the likelihood of high humidity depends solely on the presence of low ozone levels.

We are observing normal humidity. We know that low ozone levels cause low humidity, and low air pressure causes low humidity. Since we are observing normal humidity, it is less likely that low ozone levels are present. If low ozone levels were present, we would expect low humidity. However, there could be other factors influencing humidity, and it is not impossible for low ozone levels to be present even with normal humidity. Therefore, the likelihood of low ozone levels is lower than if we observed low humidity, but not zero.

We observe high socio-economic mobility and low interest in religion. Low interest in religion is known to cause high socio-economic mobility, so the observation is consistent with this causal relationship. High urbanization also causes high socio-economic mobility. Since we already observe high socio-economic mobility, the presence of high urbanization would further support this observation.  However, high socio-economic mobility can exist without high urbanization, as evidenced by the causal link between low interest in religion and high socio-economic mobility. Therefore, while high urbanization could be present, it is not necessarily required to explain the observed high socio-economic mobility.

Since we are observing normal socio-economic mobility instead, this suggests the presence of some other factor that is lowering socio-economic mobility. Low interest in religion is known to cause high socio-economic mobility.

We are observing normal socio-economic mobility.  High urbanization and low interest in religion both cause high socio-economic mobility. Since we are observing normal and not high socio-economic mobility, it is unlikely that high urbanization is present. However, it is not impossible, as perhaps other factors are suppressing mobility.  It is also possible that low interest in religion is present, which could be counteracting the effects of high urbanization. Therefore, the likelihood of high urbanization is lower than 50%, but not extremely low.
